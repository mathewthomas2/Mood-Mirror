# Mood Mirror

Small web app that updates the page background and shows a short quote based on the selected mood.

## Usage
1. Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser.
2. Click any mood button (Happy, Sad, Angry, Tired, Excited).
3. The app updates the background color and shows a quote.

## How it works
- Button clicks call [`currentMood`](script.js), which sets the page background and updates the quote box (elements in [index.html](index.html)).
- Quotes and colors are defined inside [`currentMood`](script.js).

## Development
No build step — edit files and reload the page.
